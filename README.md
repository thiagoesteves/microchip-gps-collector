# What is this?

This is a project that was developed in 2008 to collect position from GPS and save in a USB Pen-driver adapter. Both GPS and USB are modules and the microcontroller is a PIC16F88.

# What do you need?

you need to install:
 - git
 - CCS PIC C Compiler
 - Eclipse (Optional, the eclipse environment is available, but it is not mandatory).
 - The project was done in Windows
 - The Hardware (Schematics is not available yet)

# How do I build?

You need open a project in CCS IDE and add all files in it. Once you have create the project you can just compile it and burn the chip.

# How to see the path in google?

The project save just the position in the file gps_file.txt. The next step is to get the model of the kml file and replace by the position you have. The google is able to import this kml file and show the path.
